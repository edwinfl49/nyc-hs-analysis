    "# Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In\n",
    "This is a guided project part of the Dataquest.io Data Scientist courses. The primary goal is to supplement the lessons from the course with a hands-on project. The topics covers intermediate statics including how to summarise distributions, measuring the variability of distributions, and finally how to normalise distributions using the z-score in order to compare different distributions.\n",
