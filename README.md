# Analyzing NYC High School Data

The main purposes of in this project are to
- Combined different datasets together to conduct analysis
- Experiment with the Altair library to in providing visualization

This analysis takes in various datasets available about high schools in New York City, including test scores, survey results, and demographic data. We'll use the pandas library to read in the data and do a majority of the data wrangling. Once the datasets have been cleaned and combined, we'll visualize the data and look for relationships focused around SAT scores.

This was originally part of my coursework from Dataquest.io. I found the subject and data interesting, so I decided to expand on the project.
