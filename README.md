# Analyzing NYC High School Data
Exploring NYC High School survey data and SAT scores.

This was originally part of my coursework from Dataquest.io. I found the subject and data interesting, so I decided to split it off from my general repository.

The main purposes of in this project are to
- Combined different datasets together to conduct analysis
- Experiment with several data analysis and visualisation tools
